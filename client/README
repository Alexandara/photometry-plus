simplejson is no longer needed. client.py uses the python builtin json libs coming with version >=2.6

Supernova API is at:
  http://supernova.astrometry.net/api

Nova API is at:
  http://nova.astrometry.net/api


Note on supernova:
  Since supernova is undergoing continuous development, consider your API
  key for it short lived and volatile.
  
  That said:
    If you find that the client is no longer able to connect to the
    (experimental) supernova API, please check that your API key hasn't
    changed by visiting http://supernova.astrometry.net/dashboard/profile/
